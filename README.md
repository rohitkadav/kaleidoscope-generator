## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

### Kaleidoscope Algorithm
The kaleidoscope effect is achieved by:
1. Dividing the canvas into equal segments (like pizza slices)
2. For each drawing stroke, creating mirrored copies across all segments
3. Alternating between normal and vertically flipped segments for the classic kaleidoscope look
4. Using canvas transformations (rotation and scaling) for precise positioning

### Key Technologies
- **React 18** with functional components and hooks
- **JavaScript** for type safety and better development experience
- **HTML5 Canvas** for high-performance drawing and rendering
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling and responsive design
- **Lucide React** for beautiful, consistent icons

### Performance Optimizations
- Efficient canvas rendering with minimal redraws
- Optimized touch event handling for mobile devices
- Debounced resize handling for responsive canvas
- Memory-efficient history management
